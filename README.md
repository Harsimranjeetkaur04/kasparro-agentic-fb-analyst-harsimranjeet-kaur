# 🚀 Agentic Facebook Ads Performance Analyst

A Multi-Agent Autonomous System for Diagnosing ROAS/CTR Trends and Generating Creative Improvements

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a multi-agent autonomous analysis system that diagnoses Facebook Ads performance, explains why ROAS fluctuated, and generates new creative ideas for under-performing campaigns.

It was built as a placement-ready submission for the Kasparro Applied AI Engineer – Agentic Marketing Analyst assignment.

The system is fully modular, fully local (LLMs optional), and provides end-to-end analytics:

- Clean & canonicalize noisy Facebook Ads campaign data
- Aggregate and interpret ROAS/CTR trends
- Generate hypotheses about performance shifts
- Validate them using quantitative metrics
- Suggest new creatives grounded in existing messaging

## 🎯 Problem Statement

📌 "Build a multi-agent system that diagnoses Facebook Ads performance, explains reasons behind ROAS changes, identifies performance drivers such as audience fatigue or creative underperformance, and recommends new creative directions grounded in the dataset’s messaging."

The system must include 5 agents:

- **Planner Agent** – decomposes user query
- **Data Agent** – loads and summarizes data
- **Insight Agent** – generates hypotheses
- **Evaluator Agent** – tests hypotheses
- **Creative Generator** – proposes new creative direction

All prompts must:
- Follow layered prompting (Think → Analyze → Conclude)
- Enforce JSON schemas
- Use reflection / retry logic
- Operate without passing the full CSV (summaries only)

Here is a simplified version:

User Query
│

Planner Agent
│ (Generates ordered tasks)
▼
Data Agent
│ (Loads CSV, cleans, canonicalizes campaigns,
│ computes summaries & low-CTR segments)
▼
Insight Agent
│ (Produces hypotheses explaining ROAS/CTR changes)
▼
Evaluator Agent
│ (Validates hypotheses quantitatively)
▼
Creative Generator
│ (Generates 3–5 creatives per low-CTR campaign)

## 🧩 Agents & Responsibilities

| Agent | Purpose | Input | Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PlannerAgent** | Decompose query → task list | user query | ordered tasks |
| **DataAgent** | Load CSV, clean, aggregate metrics, canonicalize campaigns | dataset | summary object |
| **InsightAgent** | Generate hypotheses | summary | hypotheses list |
| **EvaluatorAgent** | Validate hypotheses | hypotheses + summary | evaluations |
| **CreativeGenerator** | Generate creatives for low-CTR campaigns | summary | creatives list |

Each agent has its own prompt file inside `src/prompts/*.md`.

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains synthetic Facebook Ads data with the following fields:

* `campaign_name`, `adset_name`, `date`
* `spend`, `impressions`, `clicks`, `ctr`
* `purchases`, `revenue`, `roas`
* `creative_type`, `creative_message`
* `audience_type`, `platform`, `country`

The **DataAgent** performs:
* Missing-value handling
* Lowercasing and standardization
* Fuzzy canonicalization of campaign names

**Summary computation includes:**
* Global metrics
* Daily trends
* Canonical campaign aggregates
* Low-CTR detection
* Creative message clustering

## ⚙️ Configuration

Configuration is handled in `config/config.yaml`.

**Example:**
```yaml
data_csv: "data/synthetic_fb_ads_undergarments.csv"
use_llm: false
similarity_threshold: 0.78
confidence_min: 0.6
```
* **`use_llm`**: Enable/disable LLM rewriting of creatives.
* **`similarity_threshold`**: Fuzzy grouping threshold for campaign canonicalization.
* **`confidence_min`**: Minimum confidence score required for validated hypotheses.
## 🏁 Quick Start (Local)
Create & activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows (Git Bash)
.venv/Scripts/activate
```
### Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Run the analysis pipeline:
```bash
python src/run.py "Analyze ROAS drop in last 7 days"
```
### Check the outputs:
| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `reports/insights.json` | Validated hypotheses + summary |
| `reports/creatives.json` | Creative recommendations |
| `reports/report.md` | Clean human-readable report |

### 🧪Testing
Run unit tests:

```bash
pytest -q
```
## Current test coverage includes:
* DataAgent functionality
* CreativeGenerator output format
* Hypothesis–evaluation merging logic

### 🤖 CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
A full CI pipeline runs automatically on each push/pull request to main.
## Workflow file: .github/workflows/ci.yml
It performs:
* Python setup
* Dependency installation
* pytest -q
* Uploads reports/ as artifacts

### 🧪 Example Output
## Example validated insight:

```JSON

{
  "statement": "ROAS decreased due to CTR drop in the last 7 days.",
  "confidence": 0.82,
  "reasoning": "CTR consistently trended downward while spend remained stable."
}
```
## Example creative recommendation:

```JSON
{
  "headline": "Experience Invisible Comfort",
  "message": "Smooth, breathable fabric for all-day support.",
  "cta": "Shop Now"
}
```
🧬 Optional: LLM Rewrite (Advanced)
To enable LLM refinement of creatives:

Set environment variable:

Bash

export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
Enable in config:

YAML

use_llm: true
The pipeline will rewrite generated creatives using a structured prompt. Fallback logic ensures JSON validity is maintained.
