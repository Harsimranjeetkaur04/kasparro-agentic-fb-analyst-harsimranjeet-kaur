# Agentic Facebook Ads Performance Analyst

**Goal:** Build a multi-agent system that diagnoses Facebook Ads performance (ROAS/CTR), explains drivers for performance changes, and generates creative suggestions grounded in the provided dataset.

This repo contains a placement-ready implementation with data cleaning, fuzzy canonicalization of campaign names, hypothesis generation, quantitative evaluation, and creative generation.
